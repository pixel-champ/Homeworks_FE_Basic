        <!-- I nested a section tag inside of the main tag wherein a header was placed. Is it semantically correct? -->
        <!-- ..or is it appropriate only when there is one section and we are not planning on adding more sections to the main tag? In this case, would just a main tag without a section tag suffice? -->
        <!-- I did so for the rest of the website. -->

        <!-- Generally , if there is just a main tag, can we add to this main tag a header and a footer, or should we first nest a section tag inside on this main tag, and then add a header and a footer inside of the section? -->
